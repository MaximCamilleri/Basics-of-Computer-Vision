# Basics-of-Computer-Vision

This repository is a collection of a few widely used techniques in the computer vision sector. These are:

### Area Processing
* Sliding windows
* Convolution of images/ROI
* Use of Sobel X and Y kernels 
* Use of Bilinear (sharpening) kernel 
* Use of Gaussian (blurring) Kernel 

### Feature Detection
* Corner Harris
* Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection 
* SIFT
* SURF
* ORB
* Feature Matching 

### Morphology
* Connected Component detection 
* Dilation
* Erosion 
* Opening
* Closing 
* Image Segmentation of handwritten text 

### Paper Implementation 
This section implements and recreates the results of [Dylan Seychell's](https://github.com/dylanseychell) paper ‘An Approach for Objective Quality Assessment of Image Inpainting Results’. It Involves inpainting using Telea and NS methods and the computation of results using MSE SSIM and PSNR. This is done on the COTS dataset provided in the paper. 

The section also involves a few other experiments on the same dataset, including, inpainting with complex backgrounds, background subtraction, object extraction, and background replacement.
